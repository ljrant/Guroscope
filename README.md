# Guroscope
Interactive R Shiny web app that visualizes Gurometry score profiles of secular gurus rated by the Decoding the Gurus podcast. Decoding scores are averaged, and profiles are compared using ordination methods (PCA or NMDS. Subjects appear as selectable "stars" in 2D guruscape, side-by-side comparisons of profiles and and guru traits. in side panel.

## üî≠ Features
- Data pulled directly from Google Sheets
- Interactive Guruscape  (2D ordination plot using either PCA or NMDS of averaged gurumetry scores for ordination). Axis can be rotated for alternative guroscopy. by default PCA1 and PCA2 are used, for PCA the highest scoring Gurus cluster  on the right field of Guruscape. 
- Clickable stars (gurus) to explore individual profiles. The Guru profiles view on right hand panel. individual gurometry scores by different decoders display in bottom panel.
- Binary traits (e.g., "Monomania", "Broicity") color-coded may be highligted as different coloured stars in the guroscape.

##### üß† What Is Gurometry?

*Gurometry* is a satirical rating framework developed by [Chris Kavanagh](https://twitter.com/C_Kavanagh) and [Matt Browne](https://twitter.com/ArthurCDent) for their podcast *Decoding the Gurus*. It rates self-proclaimed intellectuals or ‚Äúsecular gurus‚Äù based on recurring traits like "Galaxy Brainness" and "Conspiracy Mongering."

For more on Gurometry, listen to the podcast or view their [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oe-af4_OmzLJavktcSKGfP0wmxCX0ppP8n_Tvi9l_yc).
